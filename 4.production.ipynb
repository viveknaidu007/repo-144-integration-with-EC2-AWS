    "The warning you see is a standard message from Flask when running its built-in development server. It indicates that the Flask development server is not suitable for production use due to potential security and performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why You Shouldn't Ignore the Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Security Risks:**\n",
    "   The Flask development server is not designed to handle production traffic and lacks security features needed for a production environment. It is vulnerable to various security risks and attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance Issues:**\n",
    "   The development server is not optimized for performance and cannot handle high traffic or concurrent requests effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Approach for Production\n",
    "\n",
    "For running a Flask application in production, you should use a production-ready WSGI server and a reverse proxy. Here’s a recommended setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use a Production WSGI Server:**\n",
    "   - **Gunicorn:** A popular choice for serving Flask applications in production.\n",
    "   - **uWSGI:** Another option for serving WSGI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up a Reverse Proxy:**\n",
    "   - **Nginx:** Often used in conjunction with Gunicorn or uWSGI to handle HTTP requests and serve static files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Setup with Gunicorn\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how to set up your Flask application with Gunicorn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Gunicorn:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   In your virtual environment, install Gunicorn with pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install gunicorn\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run Your Flask Application with Gunicorn:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Navigate to your project directory and start Gunicorn:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `-w 4` specifies 4 worker processes.\n",
    "   - `-b 0.0.0.0:5000` binds Gunicorn to all IP addresses on port 5000.\n",
    "   - `app:app` specifies the module and Flask application instance (assuming your Flask app is in `app.py` and the instance is named `app`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up Nginx (Optional):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   To further enhance your setup, you can use Nginx as a reverse proxy:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Install Nginx on your EC2 instance.\n",
    "   - Configure Nginx to forward requests to your Gunicorn server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Nginx Configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit the Nginx configuration file (usually located at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` or similar):\n",
    "\n",
    "```nginx\n",
    "server {\n",
    "    listen 80;\n",
    "    server_name your_domain_or_ip;\n",
    "\n",
    "    location / {\n",
    "        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;\n",
    "        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n",
    "        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n",
    "        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n",
    "        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Restart Nginx to apply the changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo systemctl restart nginx\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "For development purposes, you can use Flask’s built-in server, but for production deployments, it’s crucial to use a production-ready server like Gunicorn and a reverse proxy like Nginx to ensure better security, performance, and scalability."
